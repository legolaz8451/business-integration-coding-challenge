Apache Parquet;Apache Parquet files have a horizontal partitioning of the data called Row Group. Each Row Group holds a Column Chunk for each column. The column chunks themselves are divided into Pages. The data in each page has been encoded and compressed together and is therefore inseperable.;1;2022-11-11 12:0:0.754089;55
What is CockroachDB?;CockroachDB is a partially open source distributed SQL database. Its focus is on scalability and robustness, hence the name. Behind the scenes it transforms SQL statements to key-value operations. They are executed on key-value tables spread among the cluster. The entire key-value space is segmented in small ranges and replicated on multiple nodes. Higher replication factor means also better fault tolerance.;2;2022-10-11 12:0:0.754089;68
Dynamic Partition Pruning in Apache Spark;Dynamic Partition Pruning (DPP) is an optimization to the execution of a join between a small and large data set. If a filter is applied to the smaller data set, then, thanks to DPP, Apache Spark will also apply it to the larger data set.;1;2022-06-11 18:0:0.754089;12
